            Palestinian poet and activist Omar Fares Abu Shawish tragically died
            on October 7 during the Gaza bombardment. Renowned for youth
            advocacy, he co-founded organizations and earned international
            recognition, including &quot;Best National Song of the Year
            2007&quot; and the &quot;Distinguished Arab Youth&quot; award in
            2013. His literary works, including &quot;AlƒÅ qayd al-mawt&quot;
            (2016), showcase his talent. His legacy lies in empowering youth and
            enriching Palestinian culture.
